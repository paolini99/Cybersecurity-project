# Penetration Testing and Vulnerability Exploitation on Metasploitable 3 with Kali Linux
This project is a practical **penetration test** using **Kali Linux** to attack a **Metasploitable 3** target. Key actions include **scanning the network**, exploiting **SMB vulnerabilities** to gain credentials, executing remote commands via **Metasploit**, stealing passwords with **Mimikatz**, attacking **MySQL**, and performing a **DoS attack**. The exercise highlights vulnerabilities and emphasizes the need for robust security practices.
